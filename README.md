# SR-Profile-Tool
 
The SR Profile Tool is a small Godot application designed to aid in creating character profiles. The executable version hosted here will always include the latest changes and fixes, but is not intended to be the point of use for the tool. This repository's primary purpose is for backup and development.

## Use:
To use the tool, click on the newest version in the release list on the right side of the repository page. Download and extract the .zip file and run the .exe file inside. Note that the repository itself does include the .exe and .pck files required to run the tool, but it is not guaranteed that this version of the .exe is the newest one. The only version intended to be used is the one packaged and listed in the releases section of the repository
